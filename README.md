ABPopupView is a simple 'tooltip' style view that 'pops up' on a given point on the screen and is dismissed when the user taps again

To use in your app:
1. Import the framework anywhere into your project.
2. Include The QuartzCore framework into your project 
2. Add the ABPopupView files into your Xcode project
3. Import the ABPopupView.h into your project and go from there!

A demo project is included to help you get started.

Happy Coding!
